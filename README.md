**Speech Processing for Data Mining CIA-1**
Overview
This project focuses on processing speech data for speech recognition using data mining techniques. It involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and noise removal to improve speech clarity.

Key Contributions
Explored the characteristics of speech data, including phonetics, pitch, and variability factors.
Implemented preprocessing techniques, such as noise reduction, silence trimming, and amplitude normalization.

Technical Components
Data Collection: Speech data in formats like WAV, MP3, FLAC.
Preprocessing: Noise removal, silence trimming, and amplitude normalization.
Feature Extraction: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), spectral features, pitch, zero-crossing rate, and chroma features.
Noise Reduction (Upcoming Implementation): Will apply Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to remove background noise.

Applications
Speech recognition for virtual assistants and transcription services.
Pronunciation assessment in language learning apps like Duolingo.

Future Work
Implement DFT-based noise removal for enhanced clarity.
Experiment with deep learning models for improved recognition accuracy.
